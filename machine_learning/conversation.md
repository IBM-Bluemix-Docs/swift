# Adding a chatbot
{: #assistant}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service to build applications that understand natural-language input and respond to users with human-like conversation.

The following list outlines the flow of how the integration works:

  1. Users interact with the interface that is implemented in your app.
  2. Your app sends user input to the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK.
  3. The {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK connects to a workspace, which is a container for your dialog flow and training data.
  4. The workspace interprets the user input and directs the flow of the conversation, sending a response to your app.
  5. Your app displays the response for the user.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

  * An instance of the [{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service](/docs/services/conversation/getting-started.html)
  * iOS 8.0+
  * Xcode 9.0+
  * Swift 3.2+ or Swift 4.0+
  * Carthage

Use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage){:new_window} to manage dependencies, and build the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK for your application. If you are new to Carthage, you can install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/){:new_window}:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

## Downloading and building dependencies
{: #download-and-build-dependencies}

1. Using your favorite text editor, create a new file that is named `Cartfile` in the root directory of your project (where your `.xcodeproj` file is located).

2. Add a line to specify the Watson Swift SDK as a dependency:
  ```
  github "watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  For a production app, you can specify a [version requirement](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#version-requirement){:new_window} to avoid unexpected changes from new releases of the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK.
  {: tip}

3. Use a terminal to navigate to the root directory of your project, and then run Carthage:
  ```bash
  carthage update --platform iOS
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  The {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK is then downloaded, and its framework is built in the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder of your project.

## Adding frameworks to your app
{: #add-frameworks-to-your-app}

Now that the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK framework is built, you must link and copy the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} framework into your app.

1. Open your app in Xcode and select your project in the Navigator to open its settings.
2. Select your app target and open the **General** tab.
3. Scroll to the Linked Frameworks and Libraries section and click the `+` icon.
4. In the new window that is displayed, click **Add Other** and navigate to the `Carthage/Build/iOS` directory.
5. Select `AssistantV1.framework` to link it with your app.

In addition to linking the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} framework, you must also copy it into the app to make it accessible at run time. A Carthage script is then used to avoid a particular [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216){:new_window}.

1. With your app target's settings open in Xcode, navigate to the **Build Phases** tab.
2. Click the `+` icon and select **New Run Script Phase**.
3. Add the `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks` command to the run script phase.
4. Add the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} framework to the **Input Files** list:
  ```
  $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/AssistantV1.framework
  ```
  {: codeblock}

## Adding a virtual assistant to your app
{: #add-a-virtual-assistant-to-your-app}

1. Open your `ViewController.swift` in Xcode.
2. Add an import statement for {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, for example `import AssistantV1`.
3. Create an empty function called `assistantExample` and then call it from `viewDidLoad`.
4. Add the following code for the `assistantExample` function. Be sure to update your user name, password, and workspace ID.

//
//  ViewController.swift
//  WatsonAssistantExample

import UIKit
import AssistantV1

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        assistantExample()
    }

    func assistantExample() {
        // Assistant credentials
        let username = "your-username-here"
        let password = "your-password-here"
        let workspace = "your-workspace-id-here"

        // instantiate service
        let assistant = Assistant(username: username, password: password, version: "2018-03-01")

        // start a conversation
        assistant.message(workspaceID: workspace) { response in
            print("Conversation ID: \(response.context.conversationID!)")
            print("Response: \(response.output.text.joined())")

            // continue assistant
            print("Request: turn the radio on")
            let input = InputData(text: "turn the radio on")
            let request = MessageRequest(input: input, context: response.context)
            assistant.message(workspaceID: workspace, request: request) { response in
                print("Response: \(response.output.text.joined())")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

When you run your app, the following messages are displayed in the console:
```
Conversation ID: cbb18524-1e78-4bb5-a6ea-ceb9311da391
Response: Hi. It looks like a nice drive today. What would you like me to do?
Request: turn the radio on
Response: Sure thing! Which genre would you prefer? Jazz is my personal favorite..
```
