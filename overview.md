This programming guide provides an overview of the capabilities that Swift developers can use to learn, experiment, and enhance existing applications. It is intended to define the architectures, paradigms, and conventions of web and backend programming to facilitate mobile development.

This guide shows you how to quickly integrate services into your existing applications, with the exact prerequisites, steps, code snippets, and expected outcomes for each. Additionally, you can find resources for rapid prototyping new applications that utilize these services, such as Starter Kits in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Developer Console for Apple as well as Sample Apps. Learn how to develop traditional and mobile-first end-to-end solutions in cloud environments.

With the proliferation of cloud computing, the traditional silos of web and mobile development are becoming increasing less clear. Machine learning capabilities exist on both mobile and server-side components, and Swift is robust enough to work in both environments. Learn how to leverage Swift on the server to build cloud backends, that help to expand the capabilities of Swift developers beyond the traditional Apple ecosystem, and into the world of serverless, web servers, and even mainframes.

The powerful capabilities of Swift, combined with the innovation of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, allow you to create apps with ease, agility, and exciting features like never before.
