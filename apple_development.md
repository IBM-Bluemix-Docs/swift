# Apple development on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #ios_dev}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers solutions and services to empower Swift developers and applications with the security, AI, and value demanded by your customers. With a broad portfolio of offerings and SDKs, you can leverage these services, and bring your cutting-edge applications to market quickly.

## One development platform: IBM Cloud
{: #platform}

 ![Developer types](images/IBM_Cloud_icon.png "IBM Cloud")

The developer capabilities that are built in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} align to various skill sets and provide one platform to produce, deliver, run, and manage your app. For example, from the cognitive app that is mentioned, the following {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} capabilities are of interest:

* The [**{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} developer console**](/docs/apps/tutorials?topic=creating-apps-tutorial-getting-started) includes a set of capabilities on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that helps digital and Cloud Native developers to start building production-ready apps. It includes automatic provisioning of services and "one-click" deployment to a DevOps toolchain.

* [**IBM Watson Data Platform**](https://dataplatform.ibm.com){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") makes it simple to assemble data collections, refine the data, then visualize, discover insights, and build models for use in your cognitive app.

* [**IBM Streaming Analytics**](/docs/services/StreamingAnalytics?topic=StreamingAnalytics-gettingstarted#gettingstarted) helps wrangle and analyze data streams. It is an advanced analytic platform that you can use to ingest, analyze, and correlate information as it arrives from different types of data sources in real time.

* The [**{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Continuous Delivery service**](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_getting_started#cd_getting_started) sets up a devops toolchain to automate continuous delivery of your app. You can easily enhance the toolchain to include management functions like monitoring, logging, tracking, and alerting. You can even apply advanced machine learning to your toolchain by using the [DevOps Insights service](/docs/services/DevOpsInsights?topic=DevOpsInsights-getting-started#getting-started).

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform offers many more capabilities and can be used as your comprehensive development platform.

## Overview of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} capabilities
{: #capabilities}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} developer console helps you start building apps the "right" way in minutes. Essential elements of the developer console are:

* A set of topic or channel-centric developer consoles found across the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform.
* Specific use-case starter kits that produce production-ready starter apps in various languages and architectural patterns.
* Automatic provisioning of services.
* Manage app components by using a portable app structure.
* One-click creation of a [devops toolchain](/docs/services/DevOpsInsights?topic=DevOpsInsights-getting-started#getting-started).

To understand how the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} developer console can help you rapidly build high-quality production-ready apps, see the following elements in more detail.

## Developer consoles
{: #developer_consoles}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} developer console includes areas of interest (like Watson, Security, or Finance) or a digital channel (like Mobile or Web Apps). The [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Developer Console for Apple](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appledevelopment/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") was developed for Apple developers to be able to quickly experiment with applications, and services, backed by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform. You can access these consoles by clicking the menu icon in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. For example, see the following developer consoles:

* [Watson developer console](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/watson/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")
* [Mobile developer console](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/mobile/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")
* [Web App developer console](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")
* [Security developer console](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/security/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")
* [Finance developer console](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/finance/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")

<!--Cloud native development is the process of developing apps that are optimized to leverage capabilities engendered from running on the cloud.  Flexibility, portability, scaling, rapid development, continuous delivery, and a close coupling development and operations ("devops) are characteristics of cloud applications. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} developer console quickly gets you started building cloud native applications that are ready for team development and bound for production use.-->
