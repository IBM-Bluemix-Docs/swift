# Why add back-end components?
{: #backend}

Back-end components determine how services interact, update, and change information that use databases and servers.

Applications can be built to be self-contained. They can run entirely on a device where the only external interaction comes from the user. However, the capabilities and the value that the applications can provide are restricted.

Most applications benefit from access to external resources in order to enhance and extend your application. By adding a datastore, you can have a user account enable data to be stored across your application's reinstalls and allow them to share data with their friends and other users. A corresponding web application can then be built and push notifications can be added to alert users that information is being shared by their friends.

By using back-end logic the application is further enhanced, and adds a wider range of capabilities such as location awareness, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and integration with the internet of things. Authentication and security are now a necessity, and benefit from mobile analytics.

All of these features enable an application to incrementally grow and provide greater levels of value to your users.
