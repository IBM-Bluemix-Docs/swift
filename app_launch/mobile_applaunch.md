# Managing app feature releases
{: #mobile_applaunch}

{{site.data.keyword.engage_full}} lets Developers build engaging apps by controlling reach, and roll out of app features that can provide measurable metrics. The service helps Developers to remove the coupling that exists today between app feature rollout, and app updates to production. You can now publish features without exposing it to production to gradually release new versions of an app in a controlled manner. With the {{site.data.keyword.engage_short}} service, app owners have full control over feature rollout for a targeted segment.

The {{site.data.keyword.engage_short}} service defines a feature, creates an audience based on device platforms (including custom audience attributes), and finally defines an engagement that choreographs the timing and placement of the feature. After SDKs are used, along with the feature and metrics attributes that are incorporated in the application, the service starts measuring audience experiences. You can now use your app based on this information to create customized customer engagements across various categories of your app users.

![Cognitive Engage overview](images/process_app_launch.png) Figure 1. Overview of the {{site.data.keyword.engage_short}} service lifecycle

See the following features of the {{site.data.keyword.engage_short}} service:

 - **Accelerate feature deployment**

    Accelerate delivery of features to your app through controlled release by mitigating risks. Release features to subset of audience segments and make larger rollout or roll back decisions based on real-time feedback. Separate feature rollouts from regular release cycles.

 - **Segment Audience**

    User segments can be defined based on demographic, contextual, and behavioral attributes. You can also roll out features to certain percentage of the entire user base. Key Performance indicators can be defined for each feature and client-side code to measure the results.

 - **Adapt application based on context**

    Application behavior, user interface, and notifications can be customized for specific audience segments. For example, app background can be changed based on user location. This user personalization results in higher engagement of users with the application.

 - **A / B test features**

    Gain confidence by experimentation. Two variants of application features can be compared against each other by rolling out both at the same time. Decisions can be made based on hard data.

 - **Increase Customer Engagement**

    Promote user engagement. Notifications can be targeted to all application users or to a specific set of users and devices. A message schedule can be defined. User interaction plays a vital role in customer relationships.

2. Update the Create New Feature and Metrics form with a feature name and description. You can also define the feature properties and add metrics to measure the impact of your engagement. Click **Bulk edit** to add multiple properties by editing the JSON.
3. Click **Create**. The new feature now appears on the Features panel.
4. Enable the feature after it's developed.
5. To enable a feature to be used as an engagement, click the Feature that you created.
6. In the Feature Details window, choose to Update Status of your feature to **Ready**.
7. Click **Update Status**.
8. Update your app to include the newly created attributes and feature codes in your iOS app.
9. The feature is now ready to be used.

The Feature Details window can export the feature as a JSON file, which can be used in the client application to load the default values.

## Step 4. Creating an audience
{: #audience-applaunch}

![Create Audience](images/create_audience_animated.gif){: gif}

To create an audience, complete the following steps:

### Creating an **audience attribute**:
{: #audience-attrib-applaunch}

1. Click **Audience** > **Create Attribute**.
2. Provide the following values:
  * **Name**: Provide an appropriate name for the attribute.
  * **Description**: A brief description on the attribute.
  * **Type**: Choose the attribute type.
  * **Allowed values**: Enter the attribute values that you would want to use.

  You can choose to create more than one audience attribute, as listed in the following image, based on your requirement.

### Creating an **audience**:
{: #audience-create-applaunch}

## Step 5. Creating an Engagement
{: #engagement-applaunch}

An Engagement is an instantiation of a Feature with properties initialized and attaching one of the pre-defined audiences. You can either create an engagement by using **Feature Control** or **In-App Messaging**.

### Enabling Feature Control Capability
{: #feature-control-applaunch}

Through this engagement, an app owner can control the visibility of a feature by enabling or disabling it at run time. A feature can be enabled or disabled to all the application users or to a specific set of users and devices.

Feature roll outs can be scheduled and coordinated by defining a start or end time and date. You can also choose a specific day on which a defined feature is to be enabled or disabled.

![animated gif](images/create_engagement.gif){: gif}

Complete the following steps to create an engagement by using the Feature Control:

1. You can create an engagement by using either of the following methods:
  - Click **Engagements** in the navigation pane.
  - Select **Create Engagements** on the new Feature that you created.
  - In the navigation pane, click **Overview** > **Create New Engagement**.

  The New Engagement window appears.

2. Provide a name and description to your new engagement. Ensure that you give a unique engagement name, and not one that is already listed in Engagements.
  - **Select Engagement type** as **Feature Control**.
  - To do a controlled experiment with more than one variant of the feature, select **A/B testing** on the **Select Experimentation Type**. Click **Next**.

3. Select the Feature that you created. You can also choose to add and define the variants that you might want to experiment with. Click **Next**.

### Enabling In-App Messaging Capability
{: #app-message-applaunch}

Through this engagement, an app owner can send notifications to the app users while they're actively using the application.

Messages can be targeted to all application users or to a specific set of users and devices. For every message that you submit to the service, the intended audience receives a notification.

In-app messages can be scheduled by defining a start or end date and time. You might also schedule it based on an event. These messages are more customized as they're based on analytics insights about the user's choice, interactions, device, application logs, and so on.

See the following In-app message examples:

- Send customized messages.
- Send messages to users that turned off push notifications.
- Request feedback or engage users in a conversation.
- Send relevant messages by based on what the user is looking for.
- Engage active and loyal customers.
- Inform users of app updates (launch of a new feature).
